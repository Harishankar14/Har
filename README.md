🚀 **Status:** Currently compiling... _(ETA: Unknown, might need a hotfix.)_  
💻 **Role:** Open Source Contributor, I guess i can debug better than your compiler, Assembly is lobe,  
🛠 **Skills:** Turning **"it works on my machine"** into **"why doesn’t it work anywhere else?"**  
📌 **Current Mission:** Reducing tech debt, one commit at a time.  
🔥 **Fun Fact:** I write **"TODOs"** in my code and then ignore them forever.  

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
- 🖥 **Languages I Speak:** Python, Java, C++, and trying to speak Assembly  
- 🛠 **Hobbies:**  
  - Training AI models that refuse to learn 🤖  
  - Debugging code that magically breaks when I present it 🐛  
  - Making **README** files look cooler than my actual projects 📜
  - Debugging other organization's codes like a hero, while my own bugs enjoy a luxurious, all-inclusive stay in my repo.
